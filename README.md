<h2>NetHomeFinder</h2>

NetHomeFinder is a small project running a docker container which continually scrapes immobilienscout24 for new entries, and forwards them to you directly via Telegram.

To use, get a checkout, adapt the environment variables within the docker file and run it.

Currently there is a problem with immoscout rate limiting, though.
